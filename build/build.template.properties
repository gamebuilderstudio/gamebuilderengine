# IMPORTANT Change to your local system paths before using build.xml

# NOTE: There is a bug with the 3.4.0 SDK that ships with the Flash Builder 4 Beta.
# Basically ASDoc doesn't work in our situation. Use the release version of the SDK 
# or the 4.0 version and the build will work.

# Build paths

# This is the version of AIR that is used to run the unit tests
# You shouldn't need to modify this value if you're using Flex 3.3 - 4.0
# You can find this by looking at the file version on your adl executable located
# in your Flex framework BIN directory. This should match the major and minor version
# of adl.
